**What is this?**<br>
This software is a tool that can be used on Aurora4X's database to add, remove, or edit Name Theme(s), which is not possible in-game (Only making Name Themes is supported in-game, and Naming Themes cannot be edited once created), and normally requires one to have an SQLite Browser, and knowledge of SQL.

**Current Features:**
- See Naming Themes
- See Names of Naming Themes
- Delete Names inside Naming Themes
- Delete Naming Themes
- Add Names to Naming Themes

**Planned Features:**
- Create Naming Themes
- GUI (Maybe, eventually, possibly, idk tho)

**How do I use this?**<br>
Check the wiki.(Nothing there yet lol)
